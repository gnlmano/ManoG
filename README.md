# My Data Science project portfolio.

## Academic Projects:
As part of the cirriculum for Data Science at the Barcelona School of Economics, I have completed a few machine learning assignments. The details and links to the repositories are below.

# 1. [Forest Cover Prediction Using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/gnlmano/Forest-Cover-Prediction-Logistic-Regression) 
* In this project, you have to predict the class of forest cover (the predominant kind of tree cover) from strictly cartographic and environment variables.
* There are 2 parts to this assignment. First is a binary prediction task and the second is a multi-class prediction.
* The logistic regression classifer works well for the binary prediction problem but over-fits in the multi-class prediction.
